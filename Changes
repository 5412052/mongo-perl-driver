# Change history for the MongoDB Perl driver:

{{ $NEXT }}

  [Changes]

  - Configuration options representing times have stricter validation such
    that options that should be non-negative will raise exceptions when
    given negative numbers.

  [Bug fixes]

  - Fixes failing BSON element tests on 32-bit perls.

  - Uses monotonic clock for restarting interrupted select() calls,
    if available via Time::HiRes.

  - Restores v0 behavior of negative connect_timeout_ms and
    socket_timeout_ms meaning "never timeout".

  - Restores v0 behavior of setting TCP_NODELAY and SO_KEEPALIVE
    on sockets.

  [Testing]

  - Skips t/max_tims_ms.t unless $ENV{FAILPOINT_TESTING} is true.

v0.999.999.1 2015-06-10 09:48:53-06:00 America/Denver (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [!!! Incompatible Changes !!!]

  - PERL-442 Connection string options revised to match MongoClient
    options; connection string options always take precedence

  - PERL-470 MongoDB::Cursor globals "slave_ok" and "timeout" no longer
    have any effect and have been removed.

  - PERL-471 MongoDB::Cursor 'snapshot' method now requires a boolean
    argument.

  [*** Deprecations ***]

  - PERL-398 Old 'timeout' and 'query_timeout' options deprecated in favor
    of new, more explicit 'connect_timeout_ms' and 'socket_timeout_ms'

  - PERL-424 MongoDB::Cursor 'count' method has been deprecated.

  - PERL-511 Use new CRUD method names for Bulk API and deprecate old ones

  - PERL-516 Deprecated legacy index management API methods

  - PERL-533 Deprecated 'save' method

  - PERL-534 Deprecated 'validate' method

  [Additions]

  - PERL-413 Added max_time_ms MongoDB::MongoClient configuration option to
    set default for database and collection objects

  - PERL-486 Added 'has_modified_count' method to MongoDB::UpdateResult and
    MongoDB::BulkWriteResult to ease detection of when that attributes is
    supported by a server or not.

  - PERL-490 Added 'list_collections' method on MongoDB::Database

  - PERL-500 Added 'topology_status' method to MongoDB::MongoClient

  - PERL-506 Added support for serializing/deserializing Time::Moment objects

  - PERL-515 Added new MongoDB::IndexView API

  - PERL-533 Added 'save_one' method for idempotent replace-or-upsert

  [Bug fixes]

  - PERL-536 Fixed GridFS to stop throwing an error when a known empty file has
    no chunks; errors will still be thrown if a non-empty file has no chunks.

  - PERL-540 Fixed memory leak in DateTime::Tiny inflation

  - PERL-543 Fixed a bug serializing undef from Tie::IxHash objects

  [Changes]

  - PERL-127 Integers that fit in 32-bits are now encoded as BSON Int32;
    larger integers are encodeed as BSON Int64; Math::BigInt objects are
    always encoded as BSON Int64.

  - PERL-488 MongoDB::WriteConcern method 'is_safe' renamed to
    'is_acknowledged'.

  - PERL-529 Ignores connection string option key case

  - PERL-530 Warns on unsupported connection options

  [~ Internal changes ~]

  - PERL-455 Now using connect timeout as socket timeout for topology scans

v0.999.998.6 2015-05-20 14:28:18-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [!!! Incompatible Changes !!!]

  - PERL-505 When inserting a document without an '_id' field, the _id will
    be added during BSON encoding, but the original document will not be
    changed.  (This was inconsistent between regular and bulk insertion in
    the v0.x series and during previous alpha releases.)

  - PERL-519 The $MongoDB::BSON::use_binary global variable has been
    removed. Binary data always decodes to MongoDB::BSON::Binary objects
    (which now overload stringification).  This ensures that binary data
    will correctly round-trip.

  - PERL-520 The $MongoDB::BSON::utf8_flag_on global varialbe has been
    removed. BSON strings will always be decoded to Perl character strings.
    This ensures that string data will correctly round-trip.

  - The $MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number and $MongoDB::BSON::char global
    variables now ONLY have an effect at MongoDB::MongoClient construction.
    Changing them later does not change BSON encoding.  Both are deprecated as
    well and should not be used in new code.  Instead, the enhanced
    MongoDB::BSON codec class has attributes that encapsulate these behaviors.

  - PERL-221 The 'inflate_regexps' MongoDB::MongoClient option has been
    removed.  BSON regular expressions always decode to
    MongoDB::BSON::Regexp objects. This ensure safety and consistency with
    other drivers.

  - The 'inflate_dbrefs' MongoDB::MongoClient option has been removed.
    By default, dbrefs are always inflated to MongoDB::DBRef objects.

  - The 'dt_type' MongoDB::MongoClient option has been deprecated and
    made read-only.  It now only takes effect if C<MongoDB::MongoClient>
    constructs a MongoDB::BSON codec object and is read-only so that any
    code that relied on changing it after client construction will fail
    rather that being silently ignored.

  [*** Deprecations ***]

  - As mentioned above, 'dt_type', '$MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number'
    and '$MongoDB::BSON::char' have been deprecated in addition to their
    other behavior changes.

  [Additions]

  - Added 'with_codec' method to MongoDB::Collection for easier localized
    changes to codec attributes.

  [Changes]

  - PERL-331 The MongoDB::BSON package is now a full class, implementing
    a BSON encoder-decoder (codec).  It can be supplied as an attribute
    to MongoDB::MongoClient, MongoDB::Database and MongoDB::Collection
    objects.

  [Fixes]

  - PERL-531 Bulk update/replace documents would not validate properly when
    $MongoDB::BSON::char was not '$'.  While that functionality has moved
    to the MongoDB::BSON codec instead of the global variable, all
    update/replace documents (bulk and CRUD API) are now validated after
    key munging.

  - Fixed a number of XS memory leaks from non-mortalized variables
    during BSON encoding.

  - Fixed t/gridfs to work around a bug in MongoDB 3.1.2.

  - Fixed BSON double tests on Perls with long-doubles enabled

  [~ Internal changes ~]

  - PERL-325 Updated vendored ppport.h to version 3.31

  - Refactored and reorganized perl-mongo.h and perl_mongo.c.  Removed
    unused functions and macros.

  - Removed unused vendored libyajl files.

v0.999.998.5 2015-04-30 06:12:39-04:00 America/New_York

  [*** Deprecations ***]

  - MongoDB::CommandResult changed the name of the accessor for the document
    returned by the server to 'output' instead of 'result' for clarity.  The
    'result' method is deprecated.

  [Changes]

  - Generic MongoDB::Error exceptions have been replaced with subclasses
    that have a specific, documented purpose, including: MongoDB::AuthError,
    MongoDB::GridFSError, MongoDB::InternalError and MongoDB::UsageError.

  - Calls to Carp::confess() or die() have been replaced with exceptions
    from MongoDB::Error subclasses, typically MongoDB::UsageError.

  - Failure to create indexes when constructing a GridFS object are
    ignored rather than a fatal error.

  - Now includes a longer list of default OS locations to search for
    root CA files.

v0.999.998.4 2015-03-25 14:37:52-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [*** Deprecations ***]

  - Legacy MongoDB::Collection CRUD methods (insert, update, etc.) have
    been deprecated in favor of new CRUD API methods

  - PERL-507 MongoDB::Collection::get_collection is deprecated; it implied
    subcollections, which don't actually exist

  [Additions]

  - PERL-502|PERL-503 Implement new common driver CRUD API
    in MongoDB::Collection

  [Bug fixes]

  - PERL-480 retrieving a GridFS file now throws an error if no chunks exist
    instead of returning an empty string

  - Suppressed warning about "Can't locate package MongoDB::WriteResult"
    from MongoDB::BulkWriteResult::ISA

  - Fixed incorrect 'matched_count' result attribute for upserts

  - Ensure topology type is correct whenever a server is marked unavailable

  [Changes]

  - MongoDB::Collection attributes that should not be set in the constructor
    have been made private, but with public accessors for backwards
    compatibility.  Private attributes that are set in the constructor
    (e.g. 'database') are now public.

  [Documentation]

  - PERL-464 Documented deprecation of 'last_error'

  - PERL-510 Documented MongoDB::QueryResult

  - Improved docs for MongoDB::Error with info on exported error codes

  - Clarified docs for MongoDB::Collection::get_collection

  [Removals]

  - PERL-497 The $MongoDB::BSON::use_boolean never worked; BSON boolean
    values were always deserialized as boolean.pm objects.  Rather than
    "fix" this and break people's code, the option has been removed and
    documented as such.

v0.999.998.3 2015-03-25 14:30:00-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  - Broken upload due to TLS bugs

v0.999.998.2 2015-02-23 17:10:36-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [Additions]

  - PERL-93 implemented awaitData

  - PERL-135 added ability to set write_concern at db and collection level

    writes via database commands versus via the wire protocol with OP_INSERT,
    OP_UPDATE, etc.)

  - PERL-466 added read preference attribute to Database and Collection

  - Added 'connect' function to MongoDB class for syntactic sugar

  - Added 'db' and 'coll' as aliases for 'get_database' and 'get_collection'

  - Added optional read preference argument to 'run_command'

  [Bug Fixes]

  - PERL-401 fixed index creation to always have a non-zero write concern

  - PERL-489 fixed BSON encoding bug; references to scalars with both number
    and string slots internally would crash on BSON encoding, rather than
    encode the string part as a binary.

  - PERL-477 fixed list indexes/collections when responses are too big to fit
    in a single database response

  - Fixed t/database.t for change in server error message

  - Fixed use of slave_ok and $readPreference for communicating read
    preferences to a mongos

  - MongoDB::Error exception objects now used consistently throughout
    networking code

  - removed long-deprecated MongoDB::Connection class

  - split Cursor class into new QueryResult class

    test is marked TODO and the bug will be addressed in the next
    stable release.

  - Some platforms may not compile, including Windows and some Solaris
    and OpenBSD systems; these issues will be addressed in a future release

    the Data Types documentation on using the Binary type instead of string refs
    for binary data.

    more information about the implications of this change.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Fix auth connection issues (Olly Stephens)

  - Fix driver creating duplicate connections when port isn't specified (Olly
    Stephens)

  - Fix authentication check on some versions of Perl (Olly Stephens)

0.45 - September 7, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Perl 5.8.4 and higher is now officially supported (5.8.7 was the previous
    minimum version).

  - Improved the way that connecting handles an interrupt signal.  The driver
    now continues to attempt connection for the remaining duration of the
    timeout, instead of erroring out immediately.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Fixed MaxKey and MinKey deserialization. Deserializing these types would seg
    fault if they hadn't been serialized previously.

  - Fixed Windows compilation (Taro Nishino)

  - Fixed MakeMaker arguments which were causing build problems on 5.14.

0.44 - July 26, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug-fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Added MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number flag.

    The Perl driver has always been coy about turning strings into numbers.  If
    you would like aggressive number parsing (if it looks like a number, send it
    to the DB as a number), you can set MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number to 1
    (defaults to 0, the previous behavior).  See the MongoDB::DataTypes pod for
    more info.

  - Tests should now clean up after themselves, leaving no test databases
    behind.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Setting a sort in the arguments to MongoDB::Collection::find is now passed
    through correctly to the cursor.

  - Fixed segmentation fault in array serialization: caused by specifying an _id
    field on insert and using an array (not a hash or Tie::IxHash).

  - Fixed segmentation fault in threading: if Mouse was used instead of Moose,
    version 0.43 of the driver would segfault if multiple threads were used.

  - MongoDB::Cursor now inherits the $Mongo::Cursor::slave_okay global setting,
    as well as checking if slave_okay is set on the cursor instance.

  - Fix GridFS functions to only ensure GridFS indexes on writes, allowing
    GridFS API usage on slaves.

0.43 - May 31, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug-fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Auto-detects max BSON size for inserts, which means documents larger than
    4MB can now be inserted.  See L<MongoDB::Connection/max_bson_size> for
    details.

  - Added the L<MongoDB::Cursor/info> method, which returns meta information
    about the results being returned.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - When high UTF-8 values as hash keys, the driver now croaks instead of
    segfaulting.

  - Added 'use IO::File' before IO::File is used (Michael Langner)

  - Fixed Perl 5.14 compile (Chip Salzenberg)

  - BACKWARD-BREAKING: removed old indexing syntax (if you started using the
    driver less than a year ago, this shouldn't affect you.  If you're an old-
    timer, make sure you're not using the syntax that has been deprecated for a
    year).
